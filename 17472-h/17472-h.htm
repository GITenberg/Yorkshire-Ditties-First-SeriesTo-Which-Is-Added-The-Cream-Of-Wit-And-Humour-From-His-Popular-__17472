<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>As the First Volume of the Yorkshire Ditties has been for some
time
out of print, and as there is a great demand for the very humorous
productions of Mr. Hartley's pen, it has been decided to reprint that
Volume, and also a Second One; both to be considerably enlarged and
enriched by Selections from Mr. Hartley's other humorous writings.</p>

<p>The Publishers would also intimate that for this purpose they
have
purchased of Mr. Hartley the copyright of the DITTIES, and other
Pieces appended to each Volume.</p>

<p>The Publishers presume that both Volumes will, on account of
their
great humour, be favourably received by the Public.</p>

As aw hurried throo th' taan to mi wark,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">(Aw wur lat, for all th'

Aw happen'd to hear a remark,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">'At ud fotch tears throo
th' heart ov a stooan&mdash;</span><br>

It wur raanin, an' snawin, and cowd,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' th' flagstoans wur
covered wi' muck,</span><br>

An' th' east wind booath whistled an' howl'd,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">It saanded like nowt but

When two little lads, donn'd i' rags,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Baght stockins or shoes

weather 'at's poor!</span><br>

Th' big en sam'd summat off th' graand,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' aw luk'd just to see
what 't could be;</span><br>

'Twur a few wizend flaars he'd faand,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' they seem'd to ha
fill'd him wi glee:</span><br>

An' he sed, "Come on, Billy, may be<br>

else by an by,</span><br>

An' if net, tha mun share thease wi me<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When we get to some spot
where its dry."</span><br>

Leet-hearted they trotted away,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' aw follow'd, coss
'twur i' mi rooad;</span><br>

But aw thowt awd nee'er seen sich a day&mdash;<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">It worn't fit ta be aght
for a tooad.</span><br>

Sooin th' big en agean slipt away,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' sam'd summat else
aght o'th' muck,</span><br>

An' he cried aght, "Luk here, Bill! to-day<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Arn't we blest wi' a
seet o' gooid luck?</span><br>

Here's a apple! an' th' mooast on it's saand:<br>

Worn't it gooid to ligg thear to be faand?<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Nah booath on us con

Soa he wiped it, an' rubb'd it, an' then<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Sed, Billy, "thee bite
off a bit;</span><br>

If tha hasn't been lucky thisen<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Tha shall share wi' me

Soa th' little en bate off a touch,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">T'other's face beamed
wi' pleasur all throo,</span><br>

An' he said, "Nay, tha hasn't taen much,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Bite agean, an' bite

Aw waited to hear nowt noa moor,&mdash;<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Thinks aw, thear's a
lesson for me!</span><br>

Tha's a heart i' thi breast, if tha'rt poor:<br>

Tuppince wur all th' brass aw had,<br>

But aw thowt aw'll goa give it yond lad,<br>

Soa aw sed, "Lad, here's tuppince for thee,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For thi
sen,"&mdash;an' they stared like two geese,</span><br>

But he sed, woll th' tear stood in his e'e,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"Nah, it'll just be a
penny a piece."</span><br>

"God bless thi! do just as tha will,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' may better days
speedily come;</span><br>

Tho' clam'd, an' hauf donn'd, mi lad, still<br>

Tellin us fine weather will come,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When we see thi dappled

Tho' they may net be thi marrow,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">May net fly wi' sich a
glitter;<br>

<br>

</span>But they niver leeav us, niver&mdash;<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Storms may come, but
still they stay;</span><br>

But th' first wind 'at ma's thee shiver,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Up tha mounts an' flies
away.<br>

<br>

</span>Ther's too mony like thee, swallow,<br>

Across a meadow newly shorn;<br>

Th' sun wor shinin' breet and clear,<br>

An' fragrant scents rose up i'th' air,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' all wor still.</span><br>

When, as my steps wor idly rovin,<br>

Aw coom upon a seet soa lovin!<br>

It fill'd mi heart wi' tender feelin,<br>

As daan aw sank beside it, kneelin<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">O'th' edge o'th' hill.</span><br>

<br>

It wor a little skylark's nest,<br>

An' two young babby burds, undrest,<br>

Wor gapin wi' ther beaks soa wide,<br>

Callin' for mammy to provide<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Ther mornin's meal;</span><br>

An' high aboon ther little hooam,<br>

Th' saand o' daddy's warblin coom,<br>

Ringin' soa sweetly o' mi ear,<br>

Like breathins thro' a purer sphere,<br>

<br>

Ther mammy, a few yards away,<br>

Wor hoppin' on a bit o' hay,<br>

Too feard to come, too bold to flee;<br>

An' watchin me wi' troubled e'e,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Shoo seem'd to say:</span><br>

"Dooant touch my bonny babs, young man!<br>

Ther daddy does the best he can<br>

To cheer yo with his sweetest song;<br>

An' thoase 'll sing as weel, ere long,<br>

<br>

"Tha needn't think aw'd do 'em harm&mdash;<br>

Come shelter 'em and keep 'em warm!<br>

For aw've a little nest misel,<br>

An' two young babs, aw'm praad to tell,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">'At's precious too;</span><br>

"A'a well!&mdash;tha'rt shy, tha hops away,&mdash;<br>

Thinks aw, they're happy once agean;<br>

Aw'm glad aw didn't prove so mean<br>

For they're contented wi ther lot,<br>

<h4><a name="The_Old_Bachelors_Story."></a>The
Old Bachelor's Story.</h4>

It was an humble cottage,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Snug in a rustic lane,</span><br>

Geraniums and fuschias peep'd<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">From every window-pane;<br>

<br>

</span>The dark-leaved ivy dressed its walls,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Houseleek adorned the
thatch;</span><br>

The door was standing open wide,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">They had no need of
latch.<br>

<br>

</span>And close besides the corner<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">There stood an old stone
well,</span><br>

Which caught a mimic waterfall,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That warbled as it fell.<br>

<br>

</span>The cat, crouched on the well-worn steps,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Was blinking in the sun;</span><br>

The birds sang out a welcome<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To the morning just
begun.<br>

<br>

</span>An air of peace and happiness<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Pervaded all the scene;</span><br>

The tall trees formed a back ground<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Of rich and varied green;<br>

<br>

</span>And all was steeped in quietness,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Save nature's music wild,</span><br>

When all at once, methought I heard<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The sobbing of a
child.&mdash;<br>

<br>

</span>I listened, and the sound again<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Smote clearly on my ear:</span><br>

"Can there,"&mdash;I wondering asked myself&mdash;<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"Can there be sorrow
here?"&mdash;<br>

<br>

</span>I looked within, and on the floor<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Was sat a little boy,</span><br>

Striving to soothe his sister's grief<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">By giving her a toy.<br>

<br>

</span>"Why weeps your sister thus?" I asked;<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"What is her cause of
grief?</span><br>

Come tell me, little man," I said,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"Come tell me, and be
brief."<br>

<br>

</span>Clasping his sister closer still,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He kissed her
tear-stained face,</span><br>

And thus, in homely Yorkshire phrase,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He told their mournful
case.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 7em;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">&mdash;&mdash;</span><br>

My heart was full to bursting,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When I heard the woeful
tale;</span><br>

I gazed a moment on the face<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Which death had left so
pale;<br>

<br>

</span>Then clasping to my heaving breast<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The little orphan pair,</span><br>

I sank upon my bended knees,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And offered up a prayer,<br>

<br>

</span>That God would give me power to aid<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Those children in
distress,</span><br>

That I might as a father be<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Unto the fatherless.<br>

<br>

</span>Then coaxingly I led them forth;<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And as the road was long,</span><br>

I bore them in my arms by turns&mdash;<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Their tears had made me
strong.<br>

<br>

</span>I took them to my humble home,<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Where now they may be
seen,</span><br>

<br>

</span>And now if you should chance to see,<br>

throng,</span><br>

An old man, whom a youth and maid<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Lead tenderly
along;&mdash;<br>

<br>

</span>And if you, wondering, long to know<br>

They are the little orphan pair&mdash;<br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The poor old man is me:<br>

ther'd be nowt to hooap for&mdash;nowt to live for but to dee; an'
we
should lang for that time to come just for th' sake ov a change. Ha
anxiously a little child looks forrard to th' time when he's to have a
new toy, an' ha he prizes it at furst when he's getten it: but in a
while he throws it o' one side an' cries fur summat new. Ha he langs
to be as big as his brother, soa's he can have a new bat an' ball; an'
his brother langs for th' time when he can leeave schooil an' goa work
for his livin'; an' varry likely his fayther's langin' for th' time
when he can live withaat workin'&mdash;all on 'em langin for summat
new.
Langill' for things new doesn't prevent us lovin' things at's owd. Who
isn't praad ov ther owd fayther, as he sits i' tharm-cheer an' tells
long tales abaat what he can remember bein' new? An' who doesn't feel
a soothin' kind ov a feelin' come ovver him when his mother's kindly
warnin' falls on his ear, as shoo tells him "what-iver he does, net to
be soa fond ov ivery thing new?" What a love fowk get for "th' owd
haase;" but ther's moor o'th' past nor o'th' futur' i' these feelin's,
they're not hopeful, an' its hopeful feelin's at keeps th' world a
goin', its hooap at maks us keep o'th' look aat for summat fresh.</p>

<p>Aw've heeard fowk wish for things to keep just as they are,
they say
they dooant want owt new. What a mistak' they mak! They're wishin'
for what ud be th' mooast of a novelty. Things willn't stop as they
are, an' it wodn't be reight if they did. It's all weel enuff for
them at's feathered ther nest to feel moderate contented, but them
at's sufferin' for want ov a meal's mait are all hopin' for a change
for th' better. Owd hats an' owd slippers are generally more
comfortable nor new ens, an' fowk "wish they'd niver be
done,"&mdash;"they
hate owt new"&mdash;as if it wodn't be summat new if they could
wear 'em
withaat 'em bein' done. Young fowk are allus moor anxious for changes
nor owd fowk, its likely enuff; like a child wi' a pictur book, watch
him turn ovver two or three leaves at th' beginnin', see ha delighted
he is; but in a while he turns ovver moor carelessly, an' befoor he
gets to th' end he leaves it, wearied with its variety, or falls hard
asleep opposite one at wod have fascinated him when he began. Life's
nobbut a pictur' book ov another sooart, at th' beginnin' we're
delighted wi' ivery fresh leeaf, an' we keep turnin' ovver till at
last we get wearied, an' had rayther sit quietly looking at one. But
we cannot stop, we ha' to goo throo th' book whether we like it or
net, until at last we shut us een an' fall asleep over summat new.</p>

<h4><a name="Valentine_Day."></a>Valentine Day.</h4>

<p>Ha monny young folk are langin for th' fourteenth o' February!
An ha
mony old pooastmen wish it ud niver come? Sawr owd maids an' crusty
owd bachelors wonder 'at fowk should have noa moor sense nor to waste
ther brass on sich like nonsense. But it's noa use them talkin', for
young fowk have done it befoor time, an' as long as it's i'th' natur
on 'em to love one another an' get wed, soa long will valentine
makers have plenty to do at this time o'th' year. Ther's monny a
daycent sooart of a young chap at thinks he could like to mak up to a
young lass at he's met at th' chapel or some other place, but as
sooin as he gets at th' side on her, he caant screw his courage up to
th' stickin' place, an' he axes her some sooart ov a gaumless
question, sich as "ha's your mother," or summat he cares noa moor
abaat. An' as sooin as he gets to hissell he's fit to pail his heead
agean th' jaumstooan for bien sich a fooil. Well, nah, what can sich
a chap do? Why, send her a valentine ov coorse. Soa he gooas an'
buys her one wi' a grand piece ov poetry like this:&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"The rose is red, the
violet's blue,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The pink is sweet, and so
are you."</span><br>

<p>It isn't to be expected 'at shoo can tell whear it's come
throo; but
shoo could guess at twice, an guess puddin' once, that's the beauty
on it. Then th' way's oppen'd aat at once, he's gein her to
understand what ten to one shoo understood long afoor he did. Next
time they meet shoo's sure to ax him if he gate ony valentines, an'
then he'll smile an' say, "What for, did yo?" An' shoo'll show him
th' direction, an' ax him if he knows who's writing that is? An'
he'll luk at it as sackless as if he didn't know it wor his
own&mdash;
ther heeads get cloise together, an' shoo sighs an' he sighs, an'
then, if ther's noabody abaat he'll give hur a smack with his lips
an' lawp back as if he'd burned th' skin off 'em, an' shooo axes him
ha he con fashion to goa on like that, he owt to be ashamed ov his
face? An' all th' time shoo's wonderin' why he niver did it afoor.
Then, if ther's owt abaat him, it isn't long befoor ther's a weddin',
an' then he's begun life. He's settled into his nook i'th' world, an'
he feels he's a man. Troubles come, but then ther's a pleasure i'
bein able to maister 'em. He's summat to wark for besides his own
belly an' back. He's a heart-expandin' responsibility put on him.
His country benefits by him, for a man does moor for his country 'at
leaves ten weel-trained sons an' dowters nor him 'at leaves ten
thaasand paand. Then if sich a little simple thing as a valentine
can help a chap on his rooad in lite, aw say.</p>

<h4><a name="March_Winds."></a>March Winds.</h4>

<p>These winds blow rayther strong&mdash;stronger sometimes
nor what feels
pleasant. Ther's monny a chap has a race wi' his hat, an' it luks a
sheepish sooart ov a trick, an' iverybody can affooard to laff at him
just becoss it isn't them. But for all that aw alus think at th'
year's niver getten a reight start till after March. It's like as if
it comes blusterin' an' rooarin', just o' purpose to put things into
reight trim. It fotches daan th' owd watter spaats, an' lets fowk know
whear ther's a slate at's shakey. It gives th' trees a bit ov a whisk
raand an' wuthers abaat as if it wor detarmined to clear all th' maase
nooks aat, an' give us a fair start for th' fine weather. But that
isn't all it does; it finds aat if yo've ony owd teeth 'at's rayther
tender, (an' if ther's owt i'th' world at 'll wear aat a chap's
patience its th' tooith wark. Its bad enuff, but what maks it war to
bide is, iverybody can tell yo ha to cure it, an' for all that they
wor as fast what to do wi' it when they had it as onybody else.) But
what does it matter if it does find aat bits o' waik spots, there's
nowt like knowin whear they are, for then yo do stand a chonce o'
bein' able to tak care on 'em. But it does summat else
beside&mdash;it
brings a fine day or two&mdash;an' th' grass begins to luk a trifle
greener, an' here an' thear i' bits o' shady nooks an' corners
sometimes yo can find a daisy or two; an' what is ther luks bonnier
nor th' first daisy yo find peepin up? It may be a bit ov a pindered
lookin thing, but its a daisy; an' aw dooant think at th' grandest
yo'll find all th' year 'll please yo hauf as weel as this. Little
children clap ther hands when they see it, becoss it tells 'em ther's
some fine weather comin' bye an' bye; an' they pluck it to tak hooam
wi' em' to show ther mother; an' ther grandfayther smiles when he sees
it, for it whispers a bit o' comfort to him, an' tells him to cheer
up! for th' time o'th' year's comin' when he'll be able to goa aat
o'th' door an' sit o'th green grass, an' hear th' burds sing, an' let
th' sun shine on his face, an' he willn't be feeard o' bringin' th'
rhumatic back wi' him; an' takkin it altogether it's one o' th' mooast
pleasin' things i' th' year is findin' a daisy i' March. It's strange
ha folk alter in a few years time. Luk at a child when its abaat five
or six years owd&mdash;see ha delighted it is wi' a gurt bunch ov
innocent
lukkin' buttercups an' daisies. Noatice th' same child when he's
getten fourteen or fifteen years owd. He couldn't fashion to be seen
carryin' a bunch. See him agean when he's a man. He's noa time for
daisies then. What's th' reason? Daisies are as bonny nah as iver
they wor. Ther is a difference somewhear, but it isn't i'th' daisies.</p>

<h4><a name="April_Fooils."></a>April Fooils.</h4>

<p>Niver try to mak a fooil ov onybody this month; ther's fooils
enuff
i'th world already. It's oft struck me what a varry slight difference
ther is between a wise man and a fooil; one aims at summat an' hits
it&mdash;tother aims at summat an' misses it; an' aw have known th'
time
when th' chap 'at's missed has been worth a dozen sich like as him
'at's hit. But th' world generally sets 'em daan to be wise men 'at
happen to be lucky men, an' get hold o' lots o' brass. An' ha monny
brains a chap has, if he can't spooart a pair o' kid gloves an' a
daycent hat, he mun niver hope for owt better nor to tak his place
amang th' fooils. Aw've monny a time thowt when aw've heared fowk
settin a chap daan as a fooil;&mdash;talk prattley&mdash;may be
if he wor
weighed up he's a better man nor yo this minit; yo connot tell all 'at
he may have had to struggle wi'&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Circumstances alter cases,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Th' same as nooases alter
faces.</span><br>

<p>An' it's as weel to exercise a bit ov charity towards them
'at's set
daan to be fooils. "Young fowk think old fowk fooils, an' old fowk's
sure young uns is." An aw believe th' old fowk are oft varry near th'
mark,&mdash;for th' experience of a life time is little moor nor
livin to
know what fooils we've been; an' if iver aw meet wi' a chap 'at can't
remember iver makkin a fooil ov hissen, aw shall expect to hear tell
on' him bein ta'en to th' blue slates directly. Poor Richard says,
"Experience is a dear schooil, but fooils will leearn i' noa other;"
an' who is ther 'at hasn't had to leearn i' that schooil? Its a hard
maister, an' we're apt to think, when we're under him, 'at he's war
wi' us nor onybody else; but when we've getten th' lessen off by heart
we find th' advantage on it. But ov all th' fooils it has been my
luck to meet wi,' them chaps 'at knows all are th' biggest. There's
some fowk think they're born wi' all th' wit i'th world, an' noabody
can taich 'em owt; whativer yo tell' em, they've allus "known that
long enuff sin'," or else they've "just been think in soa." Aw once
knew one o' that Sooart&mdash;one 'at had allus been thinkin soa.
One day
some mates o' mine an' me thowt we cud like a marlock wi' him, an soa
we gooas up to him an says, "A'a Jooanas! whativer does ta think?"
"Nay," he says, "whativer will yo say? What's up?" "Why," aw says,
"Jim Hyn's dunkey's swallow'd th' grinelstooan." "Well, if aw hadn't
just been thinkin soa," says Jooanas. "Well, but tha thowt wrang, owd
boy, this time," aw says, "for it hasn't." "Why," he said, "aw hardly
thowt it had." Soa he had us at booath ends. They say it taks a wise
man to mak a fooil, but aw think ther's enuff withaat makkin ony moor,
an aw niver knew a fooil i' my life at didn't think ivery body else a
little bit war cracked nor hissen.</p>

<h4><a name="Policemans_Scrape."></a>Policeman's
Scrape.</h4>

<p>Tawkin abaat policemen reminds me ov a mess one on 'em gate
into a
while sin. Aw shalln't tell awther his name or his number, becoss it's
net my wish to get ony body into trouble. It's enuff for me to say
he's a gooid-lukkin chap, an' if he isn't wed his wife is. He wor on
neet duty, an' at one o' th' haases he had to pass, lived a fine buxom
sarvent. Policemen have allus been nooated for havin a fancy for
sarvents, an' this wor like th' rest, an' befoor long they grew soa
friendly 'at shoo used to invite him in after th' maister an' th'
mistress had gooan to bed. One neet he'd crept in, an' they wor
whisperin varry lovinly together, when shoo tell'd him ther wor noa
cold mait o' ony sooart. "Awm glad on it," he sed, "for awm stoled o'
cold stuff. That luks a bit o' nice bacon at's hung up, does ta think
tha could do me a bit anent th' fire, aw think ther's as mich heeat
as'll cook it?"</p>

<p>"Well, Robert," shoo sed, "if yo'll sit daan an' wait awl try."</p>

<p>Soa he put his lantern onto th' table an' sat daan wol shoo
gate a
little dutch oven an hooked two nice collops in; but shoo fancied shoo
could enjoy one hersen, soa shoo stept up into a cheer to cut off
another, an' as shoo'd th' knife i' one hand an' cannel i' th' tother
shoo ovverbalanced hersen, and fell onto th' floor, settin up sich a
skrike as yo niver heeard. Th' 'cannel went aat when it fell an all
wor as dark as pitch, and Robert hearin th' maister skutterin daan th'
stairs thowt his best plan wor to hook it; soa he grab'd up his
lantern for owt he knew an buckled it on as he wor hurryin up th'
steps. He'd hardly left when th' maister runs aat in his shirt, callin
aat, "Police! police!" Robert comes fussin on as if he knew nowt abaat
it, an' went back wi' th' maister, who wor soa freetened wol he darn't
spaik.</p>

<p>When they went in th' sarvent had sam'd hersen up, an lit th'
cannel
agean; but th' lass forgate her fall an' th' maister his fright, when
they lukd at th' policeman an' saw he'd getten th' dutch oven i' th'
front on him astead ov his lantern, an' two bacon collops swingin in
it.</p>

<p>They settled th' matter amang thersens, but it towt that
policeman
niver to tak off his lantern until he'd done wi' it.</p>

<h4><a name="Information."></a>Information.</h4>

<p>Divine Service was held in the Temperance Hall, when the
celebrated
Dr. Foaming Drinkwater preached from the text Exodus 16 ch. 33 v.,
"And Moses said unto Aaron, take a pot," and in an eloquent sermon of
1h. 55m. the Revd. lecturer clearly showed that a pot of beer was not
alluded to in the text. Collections were made at the close of the

<h4><a name="Watterin_Places."></a>Watterin
Places.</h4>

<p>July is th' month to gooa a spawin'; an' fowk luk forrard to
it just
th' same as if they conldn't do withaat it. Th' fact is aw hardly dar
say owt agean it, for awm fond ov a bit ov a off mysen; but then
ther's different ways o' dooin it. A chap at gethers horsemuck at
hooam needn't want to mak' fowk believe he's th' Lord Mayor o' London
abrooad. Aw remember once when aw wur at a watterin' place, aw
followed some fine young ladies an' wished 'em "gooid day;" aw wornt
exactly sure whether one on 'em mightn't be th' Princess o' Wales or
net, but haasumiver, they curled up ther nooas th' same as if they'd
passed a fooamet. But in abaat a wick at after, aw met one on 'em
gooin ovver th' North Brigg wi' a slice o' traitle cake in her hand,
varry near like th' door ov a mahogany shut-up-bed, an' up to th'
elbows i' Miln greease too. Aw thowt if ony body wanted to pick a
lass for a wife they shouldn't goa to a spawin' spot. For all that,
awve nowt to say agean it&mdash;one body's as mich reight to goa an
get
sunburnt as another; but they mud as weel spaik truth, an' not allus
say it's for th' gooid o' ther health, when all th' time it's just for
a bit ov a spree. Aw could give some gooid advice to ony body at
thinks o' gooin. Tak varry little brass, an' let it be i' your
pocket, net i' yor face. Th' less yo have an' th' less yo'll spend.
Dooant buy patent booits to walk o' th' sand in. If you're anxious to
ride in a cock booat, dooant be particler to wear white trowsers. If
yo want a horse to ride, tak one wi yo&mdash;it 'll save yo a deeal
o'
disappointment; if yo want a donkey, settle ha mony legs yo could like
it to have, an' yo'll find plenty. Be careful noabody taks a fancy to
yo th' same way. Ther's as mony donkeys wi' two legs as four, an' a
bonny seet mooar. Talkin' abaat th' number o' legs maks me think ov a
chap at considered hissen rayther a sharp en; he'd a bit ov a garden
an' some cherry trees in it, an' one mornin' when he gate aat o' bed
he fan somdy had saved him th' trouble o' getherin' th' fruit; they'd
done it for him woll he wor asleep. He coom an' tell'd th' tale to
me. "A'a," he said, "if he could nobbut find aat who'd done it, he'd
stransport 'em over th' seah' that he wod!" "Why," aw says, "tha knows
burds is varry fond o' cherries, an' its happen th' burds." "Burds!"
he said, an' he winked at me varry knowingly. "Burds! happen they wor
burds&mdash;but they wor two-legged ens aw'll bet." Aw niver thowt
him
quite so sharp after that.</p>

<p>Nah just a word bi way of a caution. A chap 'at's two paand i'
debt
an' goas an' spends three paand at a watterin' place, maks hiss en
five paand behund; whereas if he'd paid what he owed he'd still ha had
one paand to spend, an' that ud goa as far o' th' top o' Blackstonedge
as three paand at Blackpool. It's worth a thowt.</p>

<h4><a name="Flaar_Shows."></a>Flaar Shows.</h4>

<p>When ther's a flaar show, clooas show at th' same time. Aw
hear fowk
tawk abaat "floral gems," and sich like stuff, but aw understand varry
little abaat it. But aw've a few gems ov another sooart at sich
times&mdash;aw call 'em gems o' thowt. Aw'm allus wonderin. Aw
wonder a
deal aw've noa business to wonder. When aw see a lot o' nice young
lasses i' muslin dresses, all spankin clean, an ommost makkin a chap
wish he worn't wed&mdash;aw wonder if ther petticoits an' stockins
is as
cleean. An when aw see a lot o' white faced lads, 'a'ts hardly getten
ther hippins off, smokin cigars, an' spittin o'th' floor ivery two or
three yards,&mdash;aw wonder if they dooant wish they wor finished,
an' aw
wonder what ther mothers is dooin to let 'em aat by thersen. An' when
aw hear tell ha mich brass they get at th' doors, aw wonder ha mich on
it wor borrow'd to goa wi'&mdash;an' sometimes aw wonder what they
do wi'
it after they've getten it&mdash;but that's noa business o'
mine;&mdash;its a
hungary job, aw know. Aw mony a time wonder, when aw hear th' bands
o' music strike up, what Lord Byron ment when he said, "When music
arose with its voluptuous swell;" for aw've booath seen an' heeard
monny a voluptuous swell at a flaar show. An' aw wonder sometimes ha
it is 'at fowk 'at goa wi a shawl o' ther heead to pick aat a sheep
heead i'th' market, can't be content unless they're donned i' silks
an' satins to goa see a twoathree marrygolds an' fushias. An'
sometimes aw wonder 'what i'th' name o' fortun aw'm dooin thear mysen,
an' if anybody axes me, aw wonder what business it is o'
their's;&mdash;an'
its just a case o' wonderin throo beginnin to th' endin', an' aw
wonder when fowk 'll leearn a bit o' wit. Aw wonder if fowk think th'
same abaat me. Aw wonder if they do. Aw shouldn't wonder if they
did.</p>

<h4><a name="October_Ale."></a>October Ale.</h4>

<p>They reckon to brew a gooid sup o' ale in October, an' they
call it
"Prime owd October." Ther's monny a war thing i'th' world nor a sup
o' gooid drink. Landlords an' teetotal-lecturers manage to get a
livin' aat on it some way;&mdash;but it's th' same wi' ale as wi'
iverything else nah days,&mdash;it's nowt made on unless it's
sharp. It's
a sharp age we live in;&mdash;hand-loom waivin' an' stage coaches
are all
too slow; iverybody an' iverything keeps growin' sharper. But we
arn't as sharp as what they are i' 'Merica yet&mdash;they're too
sharp.
They tell me they ha' to lapp thersen up i' haybands afoor they goa to
bed, for fear o' cuttin' th' sheets. Aw heeard tell o' one chap
runnin' a race wi' a flash o' leetnin', an' they say he'd ha' won but
for one ov his gallus buttons comin' off. An' another 'at used to mak
leather garters an' throw 'em ovver his heead, an' he could mak 'em
soa sharp 'at he allus kept one pair flyin'. He worn't a bad hand at
his job, he worn't that. One day aw axed a chap 'at had been, "if
they wor raylee as sharp as what fowk gave 'em credit for?" "Why," he
says, "they wor sharper nor aw liked on, or else aw shouldn't ha' come
back; but aw couldn't get on noa rooad: aw tried two or three
different trades, but aw made nowt aat, an' at last aw set up as
tubthumper; but that wodn't do. They niver wanted ought
makkin'&mdash;
they wor too sharp for that; they allus brought yo summat to
mend;&mdash;
becoss they knew a chap couldn't charge as mich for mendin' an owd tub
as for makkin' a new en; soa if they'd ony sooart ov a owd tub lagg,
or a piece of a barrel bottom, they browt it to get mended into a new
tub. Aw did as weel as aw could amang it; but one day a chap comes in
an' says, 'Aw want yo to do a bit o' repairin' for me.' 'Varry gooid,
sur,' says aw, 'an' what might yo be wantin?' 'Well,' he says, 'aw've
an owd bung hoil here, do yo think yo could fit me a fresh barrel to
it?' Aw niver spake for a minit, then aw says, 'wod yo be gooid enuff
to lend me a hand to put theas shuts up?' 'Wi' pleasure, sur,' he
said, an' he did, an' aw left th' job an' coom hooam, for aw thowt
they wor rayther too sharp." Mun, a chap can be too sharp sometimes.
My advice is, be as sharp as yo like, if yo're sharp in a reight way,
but thers some things it's as weel to be slow abaat. Be slow to do a
shabby trick, an' be sharp to help a poor body 'at needs it. Be slow
to see other fowk's faults, an' be sharp to improve yor own. Be slow
to scandalise yor neighbors, an' keep a sharp luk aat to steer clear
ov iverybody else's business; yo'll find it 'll give yo moor time to
luk after yor own.</p>

Fawkes did a gooid turn, after all, when he tried to blow th'
Parliament haase up; for we should ha' had one spree less i' the' year
but for him. Ax twenty fowk this question o' th' fourth o' November,
"Are yo gooin to buy ony fireworks this year?" an aw dar be bun to say
yo willn't find one i'th' lot but what'll say "Aw've summat else to do

still, aw'll wager at nineteen on 'em buy some after all. Ther's a

allus th' mooast to do i'th' public haases. Aw think aw shall niver
forget a marlock we had th' last plot. It wor in a public haase
somewhere between "Spice Cake-loin" an' Whiskum Dandy; ther wor a raam
full o' fowk, an' aw nooatised 'at iverybody's pockets wor swelled
aat, an' thinks aw, aw shouldn't be capp'd if ther wor a dust here in
a while. They just wanted somdy to start. In a bit one on 'em gate up
to goa aat, an' th' landlord (he'd a cork leg) drop'd a cracker into
his pocket. He hadn't gooan far when bang it went; he turns back an'
leets abaat two dozzen an' sends 'em in to th' middle o'th' raam.
"Nah, lads! for God's sake show a bit o' sense," says th' landlord,
"dooant begin sich like wark as that i' this raam, nah dooant." He
mud as weel ha' just whistled jigs to a mile-stoop; aat coom
iverybody's stock, an' i' less nor hauf a minit ther wor sich a
hullabaloo i' that shop as aw niver heeared afoor. To mak matters
war, somdy had shut th' door an' fesened it, an' th' place wor full o'
rick, an iverybody ommost chooak'd. Aw gate under th' seat, an' in a
bit somdy smashes th' window an' bawls aat "fire! fire!" I' two or
three minits ther coom a stream o' watter into th' raam as thick as my
shackle, an' smash went th' chandilleer. Th' landlord wor mad
ommost&mdash;lukkin glasses an' picters went one after tother, an'
aw faand
aat 'as aw couldn't swim, aw should ha' to shift, or else aw should be
draaned. Some kind soul managed to braik th' door daan an' we gate aat,
but aw could hear th' landlord yelling aat 'at sombdy had stown his
cork
leg. Ha' they went on aw dooant know, for aw steered straight hooam.
At abaat six o'clock th' next morning, as aw went to my wark, aw saw a
cork leg with a varry good booit on it, hangin' to a gas lamp, an aw
wonder'd whose it wor.</p>

<h4><a name="Th_Last_Month."></a>Th' Last
Month.</h4>

<p>Th' last month o' th' year; an' ther's summat rayther
sorrowful abaat
th' last o' owt, exceptin' trouble; an' still to me ther's allus
summat varry interestin' abaat owt at's "th' last." Aw've watched men
when they've been buildin' a long chimley, but aw've niver felt mich
interest till it's come th' time for 'em to put on th' last stooan;
they've labored day by day, riskin boath life an' limb, an' still
aw've felt varry little anxiety; but it's just th' fact on it bein'
th' last stooan; an' aw've hardly been able to tak my een off it till
it's been finished an' th' last man's come safe daan. But still it's
a sorrowful saandin' word is "last." Th' last farewell&mdash;th'
last
look&mdash;th' last breath&mdash;an' th' last restin, place; it
sets fowk thinkin
what there'll be after "th' last." Th' last month i'th' year isn't a
bad time to luk back an' see ha we've spent th' past eleven, an' aw
think ther's few but what'll be able to see monny a place where
they've missed it. An' if soa we'd better mak th' best o'th' few days
left to mak what amends we can. Owd Christmas comes in smilin', with
his holly an' his mistletoe, an' his gooid tempered face surraanded
wi' steam of plum puddin' an' roast beef&mdash;tables get tested
what
weight they can bear&mdash;owd fowk an' young ens exchange
greetin's, punch
bowls steam up; an' lemons an' nutmegs suffer theresen to be rubbed,
scrubbed, sliced, an' stewed; an' iverybody at can, seems to be jolly
at Christmas. Some fowk luk forrard to Christmas just for th' sake of
a gooid feed, an' aw've seen odd ens, nah an' then, 'at can tuck it in
i' fine style. Aw recollect one Christmas when Jooan o' Jenny's (we
used to call him Jooan long stummack) went to London (he'd one o'th'
best twists aw iver met wi'), an' he wor takken varry wamley for want
ov a bit ov a bitin on, soa he went into a cook's shop an' ax'd 'em ha
mich they'd mak him a dinner for? "Eighteenpence, sur," said th'
maister, "come, sit daan an' help thisen." Soa he sat daan just at
th' front ov a lump o' rooast beef, an' cut a piece off as big as a
brick, an' he worn't lang i' polishin' that an' cutting another. Th'
landlord wor rayther capped when he saw it goa like that, an' he says
"Tha'rt hungary, lad, aw think! Will ta have, summat to sup?" "Noa
thank yo, sur," says Jooan, "not just yet." He varry sooin put th'
second lot where it could keep th' furst company, an' began cuttin' a
third; this made th' maister seem varry uneasy, an' he says, "Tha'd
better have summat to sup, lad! Mun aw fotch thi a pint o' drink?"
"Noa, thank yo," said Jooan, "aw mak a practice niver to sup till
aw've hauf, done." "Why, lad," says th' landlord, "haitch will ta tak'
to drop it?" "Well" said Jooan, "if yo dooant like my company aw'm
sooary aw've come, but aw shouldn't like to leave this table for less
nor hauf a craan, if aw do aw shall be a loiser." Th' old chap pooled
awt hauf a craan an' banged it on to th' table, an' says, "Tak' it,
an' tak' thisen away, an' niver put thi fooit i' my haase agean as
long as tha's a day to live; tha'd ruin me in a wick." "Why,
maister," he says, "yo cap me sayin' soa, for aw can't ait as mich bi
a caah head as once aw cud. Aw'll tak' th' hauf crawn; gooid day,
maister; you've made a shillin 'at me."</p>

<h4><a name="Mediated_Strike."></a>Mediated
Strike.</h4>

<p>At a meeting of the tax-collectors of the W&mdash;
R&mdash;g of &mdash;shire, held
in one of the cells beneath the Town Hall it was proposed, "That we,
the tax gatherers and rate collectors of the W&mdash;
R&mdash;g of &mdash;shire do
intend to throw up our offices, unless our wages are reduced or our
labours increased, for being like unto other men, possessed of
consciences, we are frequently tormented with the thought, that we are
receiving more than what is our due, and by that means wronging the
public." Mr. Christopher Delphian moved as an amendment, "that they
should dispose of their consciences, that being a readier way of
getting over the difficulty." The chairman put the amendment which was
carried, and the consciences were sold in one lot, for 7 3/4 d., which
was carried to the fund for the entertainment of Mr. Calcraft, the
president, whenever he should visit the district on a professional
tour.</p>

<h4><a name="New_Years_Parties."></a>New
Year's Parties.</h4>

<p>Its net oft at aw have mich to do wi' parties. Th' fact is
aw'm wed,
an' young fowk dooant want me, becoss they say aw've made my markets,
an' wed fowk dooant oft ax me becoss aw suppose aw dooant oft ax them.
But this month last year aw did get a invite to a doo, an' aw went.
Aw'st net forget in a hurry what a fidget my owd woman gate into.
Shoo brushed me daan aboon a duzzen times, an' turned me raand like a
rooastin jack to see ha aw luk'd, woll aw wor as mazy as a wheel
heead, an' th' childer luk'd up i' my face two or three times afoor
they could believe it wor me. Aw heeard awr Abram telling Betty 'at
"he believed his fayther wor gooin to get kursen'd or summat." "Ho
eeah! why what are they baan to call him?" shoo says. "Nay, aw dooant
know, but my mother's been callin' him 'gaumless,' happen that's it."</p>

<p>Gaumless enuff aw thowt, an' after rubbin' my hat raand wi' a
weet
sponge (woll th' wife declared it wor as hansum as a Japan tea caddy),
aw set off. Aw seized howd o'th' nob when aw gate to th' door, an' aw
gave a gooid pawse, same as aw do at hooam, A fine young gentleman
oppen'd it, an' after starin' at me for two or three minits, he said,
"Walk in, sur." Aw doff'd my hat an' did soa; an' he! what a smell!
"By gow, lad," aw said, "its enuff to mak my maath watter is this,
ther's nowt awm fonder on nor onions, an' aw con smell ther's some
cookin'&mdash;they'll be frying some liver, aw dar say. Are ta th'
maister's lad?" aw axed. "Noa, sur," he said; "a'wm th' waiter."
"Why tha needn't wait o' me," aw said, "aw'll luk after mysel."
"Come this way, sur." he said, "aw'll introduce yo'. What name shall
aw say, sur?" "Does ta think aw am not known?" aw says; "nah aw'll
tell thi what it is: if tha keeps diddlin after me like tha has done
sin' aw come in, as if tha thowt aw wanted to stail summat, awst just
twist thi neck raand." Th' maister heeard me tawkin, an' coom to
shake hands wi' me, smilin' all ovver his face delightedly. He hook'd
his arm i' mine, an' walked me into a grand raam full o' ladies an'
waiters (aw made 'em aat to be waiters coss they wor dressed like him
'at stood at th' door.) "This is my old friend, the Almenack maker,"
he said, an' they all gate up an' sat daan agean. When aw luk'd raand
aw thowt, "Aw'm in for it this time," for aw could mak it aat to be
nowt but a meetin' to kursen a lot o' childer', an' varry likely they
wanted me to stand godfayther for 'em. Aw saw noa babbies ony-where,
but then aw'd heeard fowk tell abaat th' quality havin' weet nurses
for ther bairns, an' aw made it aat 'at thease must be um, on accaant
o'th' way they wor dressed, for they wor all i' white, an' ther's nowt
easier weshed, an' aw thowt to mysen, "Aw'll tell my owd woman to have
her gaon made i' th' same pattern when shoo's ony more to suckle, for
it must save a deal o' trouble, an' be for ivver better nor havin' a
lot o' hooks an' eyes botherin' abaat th' child's face." But thear aw
sat, an' as noabody said owt to me, aw said nowt to noabody. In a bit
ivery body began pairin' off, an' th' maister says, "Come, my friend,
you must take a lady to dinner," an' a reight grand young woman coom
an' tuk howd o' mi arm, an' we follow'd aat i' prussesshun, like they
do at a burrin. When we gate into th' next raam aw fan aat mi mistak
abaat all th' chaps being waiters, for they sat daan to th' table same
as th' maister an' me, soa aw thowt varry likely they wor locals, or
summat i'th' missionary line. Aw niver saw as mich stuff to ait i'
all my life, except in a cook shop. "Shall I pass you a little soup,"
said th' maister? "Noa, thank yo," aw said, "aw weshed me afoor aw
coom." "Not soap, my good friend, I mean soup," he said. "Oh! broth,
is it? Aw did'nt know what yo ment. Eeah, aw'll tak a soop o' broth,
if yo please, an' a bit o' suet dumplin,' if yo have a bit." When aw
said soa, a lot began a cough in', the same as if they'd a boan i'
ther throit, an' th' maister oppened sich a shop 'at aw thowt th' top
ov his heead had come off, but aw reckoned to tak noa noatice an' aw
worked away wi my gapin' stick woll th' maister axed me ha aw liked my
ox tail soup. "Dun yo call this ox tail soup," aw said, an' aw beld
up a caah tooith ommust big enuff to mak a knife heft. Aw thowt it
war a gooid joak, but noabody else seem'd to see it, an' th' mistress
ordered th' waiter to tak it away instantum.</p>

<p>When we'd all etten woll we' wor om most brussen they browt a
lot o'
black bottles wi' silver necks in, an' we'd all a glass o' some sooart
o' pop. By th' heart an' it wor pop too. "Dun yo mak this yoursen,
mistress?" aw axed. "By gingo, this licks awr traitle drink into fits,
yo mun give me th' resait, if yo have it." "This is shampane, sur,"
shoo said. "Aw dooant care whether it's sham or not, it's as gooid as
owt o'th' sooart aw've tasted, aw'll thank you for another drop,"
"Help yourself, my friend," said th' maister, an aw did, aboon a bit,
but ha long aw wor at it or ha monny bottles aw emptied aw niver
knew, for some ha aw fell asleep, an' when aw wakken'd aw wor at
hooam, an' my owd wornan wor callin aat, "Are ta baan'ta get up,
yond's th' last whew."</p>

<h4><a name="Smiles_Tears_Getting_on."></a>Smiles,
Tears, Getting on.</h4>

<p>Smiles are things aw like to see, an'. they're noa less
acceptable
becoss sometimes ther's a tear or two. A chap at's a heart ov a
reight sooart under his waistcoit cannot allus be smilin'. Awve met a
deal o' sooarts o' fowk i' my bit o' time, an' th' best aw iver met
had a tear i' ther ee nah an' then. If ther's owt aw hate to see, its
a chap at's allus smilin'; an' if iver yo meet sich a one set him daan
to be awther a haufthick or a hypocrite&mdash;yo'll be sure to be
reight.
It'll be time enuff to be allus grinnin' when all th' warkhaases an'
th' prisons are to let&mdash;when lawyers have to turn farmers, an'
bumbaileys have to emigrate&mdash;when yo connot find a soldier's
or a
policeman's suit ov clooas, except in a museum&mdash;when ther's
noa
chllder fun frozen to th' deeath o' London Brig&mdash;an' when poor
fowk
get more beef an' less bullyin'. If iver sich a time comes woll aw
live, aw'll laff wi' th' best on em, but till then a claad sometimes
will settle on mi here,&mdash;an awm glad 'at it is soa.</p>

<p>Aw niver see a chap 'at's tryin to get on but what he reminds
me ov
once gooin to a Baptist chapel to see a lot o' fowk kursened.
Everybody wor feightin' for th' front pews, an' them 'at gate 'em had
to haddle e'm an' net be perticular abaat ther shirt
collar&mdash;an' when
a chap starts aat for a front place i' this life he has to rough it,
an' if he succeeds aw wonder sometimes if he's ony better off nor them
'at gate th' front seeats i'th' chapel, for all 'at wor behund 'em
seem'd to be tryin' to shove 'em ovver into th' bottom, an' nah an'
then aw noaticed odd uns 'at could bide noa longer, an' gave up th'
spot they'd fowt soa hard to get, an' sombdy behund, 'at had hardly
tewd a bit dropt into th' seat. And sich is life: it isn't allus th'
workers 'at succeed, net it marry! its th' skeeamers! it's them 'at
keeps ther een oppen. But aw con allus thoil 'em owt they get, if,
when they're climbin' up th' stee, they niver put ther heel on another
chap's neck, by traidin' on his fingers, to mak him lawse his hold.
It's a wrang nooation 'at some fowk have getten, to "get brass
honestly if yo can, an' if yo cannot, try to keep a easy conscience,
an' do baat it." Some chaps 'll niver get on; they're allus gooin' to
mend, but they niver start. Sich like should tak a pattern throo th'
Almenack makkers&mdash;they've lost eighteen haars this last three
years,
an' if they didn't mind they'd loise six mooar this time, but they tak
care net to do soa,&mdash;they shove a day extra into February to
mak it
up, and they call it "leap year," and it ud be a rare gooid job if
fowk wod tak a few laups this year;&mdash;laup aat o'th' alehouse
on to th'
hearthstun at home&mdash;laup aat o' bed i' time for th' church ov
a Sunday
momin'&mdash;laup aat o' th' clutches o' th' strap
shop&mdash;laup aat o' th'
gate o' bad company&mdash;laup up to yo're wark wi' a smile, an'
laup back
hooam wi' it, an' yo'll find th' wife's heart ul laup wi joy to see yo
comin' back cheerful, an' th' childer ul laup on to yo'r knee, an'
yo'll be capt ha easy it'll be to laup over ony bits o' trouble 'at
yo' meet wi'. But alus laup forrard if it's possible; for if yo try
to laup backards yo'll run th' risk o' braikin yo'r neck, an' noabody
pities them 'at laups aat o' th' fryin' pan into th' fire, an' it's a
easy matter to miss it.&mdash;Aa dear o' me! aw think it
is!&mdash;and yo'd
think soa if yo'd seen what aw saw once. A mate o' mine courted a
lass, an' he'd monny a miss afore he gat throo wi it. He used to go
an' tawk to her throo a brokken window 'at ther wor i' th' weshhaase,
an' one neet shoo'd promised to meet him thear, an' he wanted to kuss
her as usual, but he started back. "Nay, Lucy," he said, "aw'm sure
thar't nooan reight. Has ta been growin' a mustash?" Mew! mew! it
went; an' he fan aat he'd kuss'd th' owd Tom cat. When th' neighbours
gate to know, they kursened him "Kusscat," an' they call him soa yet.
But that worn't all; for when he went to get wed he wor soa flustered
woll he stood i' th' wrang place, an' when th' time coom for him to
put th' ring on, he put it on th' woman next to him&mdash;he thowt
it
didn't mean, for he cud get it swap'd after, but when it wor ovver
they all began to find aat ther'd been a mistak. "Why, Kusscat," said
one, "what's ta been doin'? Tha' s getten wed to thi mother." Th'
parson look'd glum, but he said, "It's noa use botherin' nah, its too
lat, you should ha' spokken afoor&mdash;an' aw think he's fittest
to be wi'
his mother." But he roar'd like a bull, an' begged th' parson to do
it ovver, an' do it reight; but Lucy said, "He'd noa cashion, for
shoo'd live an' dee an owd maid for iver afoor shoo'd have ony chap
second hand." But her heart worn't as hard as shoo thowt, soa, shoo
gave in, an' th' next time they managed better.</p>

<h4><a name="Mysterious_Disapperance."></a>Mysterious
Disapperance.</h4>

<p>A short time ago Mr. Fitzivitz, of Rank end, was seen to be
swimming
at a great rate and making a most extensive spread in the river plate.
Several friends cautioned him not to go so far out of his depth, but
he was utterly heedless of advice, he dived still deeper, and was
observed to sink over head and ears in debt, leaving a large circle of
friends to bewail his loss. His body has since been recovered, but
all that could have comforted his anxious friends had fled, alas for
ever.</p>

<h4><a name="Sam_it_up."></a>Sam it up.</h4>

<p>Ther's a deal o' things scattered raand, at if fowk ud tak th'
trouble
to pick up might do 'em a paar o' gooid, an' my advice is, if yo meet
wi' owt i' yor way 'at's likely to mak life better or happier, sam it
up, but first mak sure yo've a reight to it. Nah, aw once knew a chap
at fan a topcoit, an' he came to me, an' says&mdash;"A'a lad! awve
fun one
o' th' grandest topcoits to-day at iver tha clapt thi' een on." "Why,
where did ta find it?" aw says. "Reight o' th' top o' Skurcoit moor."
"Well, tha'rt a lucky chap," aw says, "what has ta done wi' it?" "Aw
niver touched it; 'aw left it just whear it wor." "Well, tha art a
faoil; tha should ha' brout it hooam." "E'ea! an' aw should ha' done,
but does ta see ther wor a chap in it." Aw tell'd him he'd made a
fooil on me, an' aw consider'd mysen dropt on, but noa moor nor he wor
wi' havin' to leave th' coit. "Neer heed," he said "fowk can allus do
baat what they can't get," an' aw thowt ther wor a bit o' wisdom i'
what he said. But what caps me th' mooast is at fowk tug an' tew for
a thing as if ther life depended on it, an' as sooin as they find they
cannot get it, they turn raand an' say they care nowt abaat it. We've
all heeard tell abaat th' "fox an' grapes," an' ther's a deal o' that
sooart o' thing. This world's full o' disappointments, an' we've all
a share. Th' Bradford Exchange wor oppened this month, 1867, an' aw
luk on it, that wor a sad disappointment to some. "Exchange is noa
robbery," they say, but if some fowk knew what it had cost, they might
think it had been a dear swap. Ther are fowk at call it "a grand
success"&mdash;but then awve heeard some call th' Halifax Taan Hall
"a
grand success," but they haven't made me believe it. It may do a deal
o' gooid, aw'll not deny that; it may taich fowk to let things alooan
at they dooan't understand&mdash;let's hooap soa. Ovver th'
door-hoil
they've put "Act Wisely," an' it's time they did. Its summat like
telling a chap to be honest, at the same time yo'r picking his pocket.
But we've noa business to grummel, its awr duty to "submit to th'
powers that be" (if they're little ens); but a chap cannot help
langin' for th' time when brains an' net brass shall fit a man for a
Taan Caancillor. But fowk mun get consolation aat o' summat, soa they
try to fancy th' Taan Hall luks handsome. Its like th' chap 'at saw
his horse fall into th' beck;&mdash;he tugg'd an' pool'd, and
shaated an'
bawl'd, but th' horse went flooatin' on, plungin' its legs abaat,
makkin' th' watter fly i' all direckshuns but it wur noa use, for it
wur draanded at th' last. When he went hooam he tell'd th' wife abaat
it</p>

<p>"What does ta say?" shoo says; "is it draanded?"</p>

<p>"E'es, it's draanded, lass; but it ud ha' done thi e'en gooid
to ha'
seen it, aw wor capt,&mdash;mun it wur a topper to swim, an' that's
a
comfort; tha knows we could niver ha' known that if it had niver been
tried."</p>

<p>Lets hooap 'at when they've another to build they'll do
better. Its
niver too late to mend, an' we're niver too owd to learn; but its hard
wark to taich some. Aw remember once a chap tellin' me hah they made
sooap, an' he said "three-thirds o' sooap wor tollow, an' tother
summat else." Aw tried to show him 'at it couldn't be soa, for if
three-thirds wor tollow it must be all tollow; but he said, aw
"needn't start o' taichin' him; when he'd been a sooap boiler twenty
year he owt to know." Aw saw it wor noa use me talkin', for as
Wordsworth says (or else he doesn't)</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"Twor throwing words
away, for still,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The soap-boiler wod have
his will,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And said, "Three-thirds
wor tollow.'</span><br>

<p>But who is ther 'at niver does wrang? net th' odd en! Them 'at
live
i' glass haases shouldn't throw stooans; soa we'll drop it. We're all
fooils at times.</p>

<h4><a name="Fooils."></a>Fooils.</h4>

<p>Ther's some born fooils, an' ther's some mak thersen fooils,
an'.
ther's some get made fooils on. When we hear fowk tell tales abaat
sein' boggards, an gettin' ther planets ruled, we think it saands
fooilish. Nah an' then one turns up rayther simple, an' a body con
hardly help laffin'. It's net long sin' aw heeard tell of a owd woman
goin' to th' Pooast Office i' Bolton, an' axin to see th' maister, an,
when he coom shoo said shoo wanted to know hah monny stamps it 'ud
tak' to send a mangle to Yeaworth. He couldn't tell her, an' shoo went
away thinkin' what a fooil he wor net to know his business better nor
that, an' he thowt what a fooil shoo wor for ax in sich a question.
An' soa it is;&mdash;we're apt to think iverybody fooils but ussen,
an'
them 'at belangs to us. Yo doant oft find a mother or fayther 'at
thinks ther lad's a fooil (unless he gets wed, an then they allus say
soa.) Iverybody's'child is th' grandest an' th' cliverest i'th world.
But aw couldn't help laffin' one day when I heeard a chap braggin'
abaat his lad. "Aa," he said, "he's cliverest lad of his age aw iver
met; he's nobbut thirteen year owd an' he con do owt." Just as he wor
sayin' soa th' lad coom into th' raam, aitin' a raw turnip, an' his
fayther thowt he'd show him off a bit, soa he said, "Jack a want thee
to go an' messur th' length o' that piece o' timber 'at's i'th yard,
an come tell me." Soa he gave him his two-fooit rule, an' th' lad
went. Aw thowt he wor a long time abaat it, but in a bit he coom
back. "Well Jack," said his fayther, "ha long is it? spaik up, that's
a fine lad." "Why," he says, "it's th' length o' yo'r rule, an' my
pocket comb, an' this piece o' band." "That's reight," said his
fayther, "tha con goa hoam," put aw nooaticed 'at be did'nt brag abaat
him quite so mitch at after.</p>

<p>If a chap doesn't want to be thowt a fooil he should niver
start o'
showin' off befoor fowk till he knows what he's abaat, an' ther's noan
on us knows iverything. Aw remember once go in' to th' sale ov a
horse, an' th' auctioneer knew varry little abaat cattle, an' he began
praisin' it up as he thowt. "Gentlemen," he said, "will you be kind
enough to look at this splendid animal! examine him, gentlemen; look
at his head; why, gentlemen, it's as big as a churn! an' talk about
points&mdash;why, it's all points; you can hang yo'r hat on any
part of
him!" He'd just getten soa far, when th' chap 'at belang'd th' horse
could bide it noa longer, soa be laup'd up an' pooled th' auctioneer
daan bith' hair o'th' heead. "Tha may be an auctioneer," he said,
"but tha'rt noa ostler." But it isn't long sin' aw wor at a sale o'
picturs, i'th' Teetotal Hall at Halifax, an' th' chap 'at wor sellin'
put up one lot an' made this speech:&mdash;"Ladies and
Gentlemen,&mdash;The
next lot I have the pleasure to offer you are three picturs of 'Joan
of Arch' a French lady of distinction, who fought at the Battle of
Waterloo against the Duke of Wellington, and was afterwards burnt at
the siege of Moscow. How much shall I say for this lot?" Aw walk'd
aat when awd heeard that, for aw thowt he might happen be a ostler,
but blow me if he wor fit for an auctioneer. But we con forgi' a chap
lukkin fooilish sometimes, if he doesn't mak' other fowk luk soa; but
when that chap at Saathawarm put bills up to call a meeting o'th'
committee to consider what color to whitewash th' schooil, they all
felt fooilish. A young chap 'at's just popp'd th' question to a young
woman feels rayther fooilish if shoo says "Noa." An' if shoo says
"Yes," he may live to think he wor fooilish. A chap feels fooilish
when he's been runnin aboon a mile to catch th' train, an' just gets
thear i' time to see it move off an' leave him. A chap feels fooilish
when he goas to th' chapel when ther's a collection, an' finds he's
left th' hawpenny at hooam he thowt o' givin', an's nowt noa less nor
hauf a craan. A chap feels fooilish if he's been rakein' aat all th'
neet, an' when he gets hooam his wife finds a woman's neet-cap hung to
his coit button. A chap luks fooilish when he's tellin' a tale an'
forgets hah it finishes. A woman luks fooilish when shoo's lost her
hair pins, an' her false bob's hingin' daan her back. An' ther are
times when we're all fooilish, an' awm feeard if aw doant stop yo may
begin to think me fooilish, soa aw'll drop it.</p>

<h4><a name="Cleenin_Daan_Month."></a>Cleenin'
Daan Month.</h4>

<p>May is abaat th' warst pairt o'th' year for a wed chap, for he
connot
walk aat, an' he cannot be comfortable at hooam, becoss it's th'
cleeanin' daan time. Talk abaat weshin' days! they're fooils to
cleeanin' days. Buckstun lime an' whitewesh, bees-wax an'
turpitine&mdash;
black-leead an' idleback, stare a chap i' th' face ivery where. Pots
an' pans&mdash;weshin' bowls an' peggy tubs, winteredges an' clooas
lines&mdash;
brooms an' besoms&mdash;dish claots an' map claots, block up ivery
nook
an' corner; an' if iver ther is a time when a chap darn't spaik it's
then. If he thinks th' haase is cleean enuff, an' doesn't want owt
dooin' at, his wife's sure to call him a mucky haand, an' say 'at he
wodn't care if he wor up to th' shoo tops i' filth; an' if he says he
thinks it wants a cleean, shoo'll varry sooin ax him if he can tell
her whear ther's another haase as cleean, for shoo doesn't know one,
an' if he does, he's welcome to goa. But it all ends i' th' same
thing&mdash;its th' time o' th' year for a reight upset, an' it 'll
ha to
have it, whether it wants it or net. Ther's noa way to suit a woman
at sich times, but to be as quiet as yo can. If yo say, "Come, lass,
con aw help thi a bit," shoo's sure to snap at yo, as if shoo'd bite
yor heead off, an' tell yo to get aat ov her gate, for yor allus under
her nooas, woll shoo can do nowt. An' if yo goa aat o'th' gate,
shoo'll ax yo as sooin as yo come in, ha yo can fashion to spend' yor
time gaddin abaat when yo know ha things is at hooam, an' you dooant
care th' toss ov a button for her, but just mak her into a slave, an'
niver think o' sich a thing as liggin' on a helpin' hand. Ther's noa
way to do but to bide it as weel as yo can, an' say little, for it
doesn't last long. But even when its ovver, yo mun be careful what yo
say, for if yo tell her yo think it luks better for th' labor, shoo's
sure to say at "shoo sees varry little difference, an' shoo wor fare
capt, for ivery thing wor as cleean as a pin." An' if yo say yo can
see noa difference, shoo'll say, "Tha can see nowtt,"&mdash;but
shoo knows
whether its different or net, for shoo's taen aboon a barra' looad o'
muck aat o' that haase that wick. Soa my advice is, to say nowt at
sich times till yo're axed, an then say as they say. Aw once heeard
ov a young couple at wor baan to get wed, an' they made it up allus to
say an' think alike, an' then they'd be sure net to fall aat; soa they
went to th' church an' gate made man an wife, an' as they wor walkin'
hooam he said, "Aw think this is th' happiest day o' awr lives."
"E'ea," shoo says, "aw think it is." "Aw think we shall have some
rain afoor long," he said. "E'ea," shoo says, "aw think it luks
likely for weet." "A'a did ta iver see a faaler bonnet nor that lass
has on," shoo said? "Noa lass, aw think aw niver did," he replied;
"but what a bonny lass shoo is, isn't shoo?" "Nay, nobbut middlin',"
shoo says. "Well aw think her a beauty." "Aw wonder where tha luks,"
shoo said, "but if tha'rt soa taen wi' her, tha con have her astead o'
me." "Nay, lass," he said, "tha knows we've agreed allus to think an'
say alike, an' awm sure shoo's a varry bonny lass." "Well an' awm
sure shoo's as plain a stick as iver aw saw i' all my life, an' if aw
agree to say an' think what tha does, it wor cos aw thowt tha wor
reight i' thi heead." Soa they walk'd hooam lukkin varry glum, an'
differ'd for th' futer same as other fowk. When a chap gets wed he
should be ready for th' warst. Aw once knew a chap at fell i' love wi
a woman 'at he met in a railway train, an' as they lived a long way
apart, they did ther coortin i' writin' an' at last th' day wor fixed
for 'em to get wed. Joa went to fotch her an' walk her to th' church,
an' as they wor gooin' he thowt shoo walked rayther queer, soa he
says, "Susy, does ta limp?" "Limp!" shoo says, "net aw, aw limp
noan." Soa they went on, an' just as they wor gooin' into th' church,
he said, "Susy, awm sure tha seems to limp." "A'a, Joa," shoo says,
"aw wonder what tha'll say next." Soa Joa an' Susy gate wed. When
they wor gooin hooam he said, "Susy, awm sure tha limps." "Aw know aw
limp," shoo says, "aw allus limp'd; is a woman ony war for limpin'?"</p>

<h4><a name="Hay-Making."></a>Hay-Making.</h4>

<p>I hope my readers will regard that varry gooid advice, when
they see
th' grass cut&mdash;"Mak hay woll th 'sun shines." There's nowt aw
like
better nor to spend a day or two in a hay field. Tawk abaat "Ho de
Colong!" It doesn't smell hauf as weel to me as a wisp o' new made
hay. An' them 'at niver knew th' luxury a' gooin' to bed wi' tired
booans, should work i'th' hay-field for a wick. It'll do onnybody
gooid; an' if some o' them idle laewts 'at stand bi a duzzen together
at th' loin ends _laikin_ at pitch an' toss, wod goa an' _work_ at
pitch an' toss, they'd be better booath i' mind an' body an' pocket.
Tossin' th' hay is booath healthful an' lawfur but tossin' hawpneys
(especially them wi' heeads o' booath sides) is nawther. Hay makkin'
is a honest callin', an' when a chap is gettin' his livin' honestly
(noa matter what he does), he feels independent,&mdash;an' when a
chap
feels soa, he can affooard to spaik what he thinks. Aw remember once
callin' at th' "Calder an' Hebble" public haase, an' sittin' in a raam
wi' a lot o' young swells 'at coom throo Sowerby Brigg; an' in a bit,
a trampified lukkin' chap coom in, an' called for a glass o' ale.
This didn't suit th' young gentlemen, soa one on 'em says to him,
"Fellow, you are an intruder." "Tha'rt a liar," th' chap says, "awm
nowt at sooart, awm a cheer-bottom mender an' aw've sarved mi time to
it." "You don't understand me, sir; what I mean is that you have no
business here." "Noa, lad; aw niver come to theeas shops when aw've
ony business, aw allus do that furst." This rayther puzzled th' young
swell an' his face went as red as a hep, cos aw laff'd at him; an' he
struck his naive o'th' table; "Sir," said he, "will you take your
departure?" "Noa," he said, "aw'll tak nowt 'at doesn't belang to me
if aw know on it." "You're an insolent scoundrel, and I leave you
with contempt." "Yo can leeav me wi' who yo like," he said, "awst
mislest noabody if they behave therlsen". They all went an' left him,
an' as sooin as they'd getten aat o'th' seet he set up a gurt laff,
an' called for another glass; an' aw nooatised at he gave th' landlord
a Sovereign to tak pay aat on, an' when he brout him his change back,
he said, "Thank you, sir," an' bow'd to him as if he'd been one o'th'
gentry. This happened o'th' same day as aw'd been at Briggus, an'
awst net forget that in a hurry:&mdash;aw'll tell yo abaat it. It
wor a
varry hot day, an' aw'd walked throo Halifax, an' wor beginin' to get
rayther dry, an' when aw'd getten ommost thear, aw saw a booard shoved
aat ov a chamer winder, wi' th' words painted on, "Prime Ginger Beer
Sold here," soa aw went into th' haase an' ax'd for a bottle.
He browt me a old hair oil bottle filled wi' summat, an a varry
mucky-lukkin glass to sup aat on. "Cannot yo let me have a cleean
glass,
maister?" aw axed. "That's clean," he says, "for aw bowt it aboon
twelve months sin, an'it's niver been used for owt but pop." Aw
emptied th' bottle into it, an it lukk'd ommost like milk sops. "What
do yo call all thease things at's swimmin' abaat?" aw says. "O,
that's yeast, young man; it's a varry gooid thing for ther inside;
aw'd a doctor once call'd for a bottle, an' he wodn't let me tak a bit
aat: it does fowk gooid." "Well but wodn't he let yo tak some o'
theas pieces o' cork aat?" aw axed. "Net a bit! for he said they
acted tother rooad, an' it wor th' best to sup th' lot." "Do yo sell
a gooid deal o' this, maister?" "A'a bless yo! aw do that. Ther wor
a real lady coom here o' Sunday afternooin, an' shoo supp'd seven
bottles, an' shoo said shoo'd ha supped seventeen but her stumack wor
varry kittle, an' shoo wor feear'd e' upsettin it." "An' wor ther as
mich yeast in 'em as ther is i' this?" aw said. "E'ea! an' moor i'
some." "Why, then," aw said, "aw should think shoo'd rise early i'th
mornin'." "Ther's nowt noa better for gooin' to bed on, nor for
gettin' up on, nor that pop." Just then somdy coom in for a hawporth
o' mustard, an' woll he turn'd raand aw emptied it daan th' sink, paid
mi penny, an' hook'd it. Soa mich for Briggus, aw thowt. Aw've oft
heeard it spokken on as a risin' place, an noa wonder if they swallow
yeast at that rate. But aw dooant see what all this has to do wi'
haymakkin', soa aw'll rake up noa moar sich like things, for fear yo
pitch into me.</p>

<h4><a name="Holinworth_Lake."></a>Holinworth
Lake.</h4>

<p>Th' mooast remarkable thing 'at aw' con recollect abaat this
time last
year, wor a trip to Hollinworth Lake. Ther'd been a collection made
at the Longloin Sunday Schooil for a new gas meeter; an after they'd
getten th' brass, they bethought 'em 'at th' old en could be made do,
an' soa th' taichers agreed to have a trip wi' th' funds. They argued
a gooid deeal abaat ha to spend it, an' at last it wor decided they
should walk all th' rooad, an' spend it as they went on. They started
aat at four o'clock one Setterday mornin' i' furst rate fettle. Ther
wor six men an' seven women; but as th' superintendent wor as big as
two, they considered thersen weel paired. They trudged nicely on till
they gate to Bolton Brow, an' then two or three began to feel faint,
an' Swallow (that's th' superintendent's name) propooased 'at they
should have a drop o' drink to revive 'em. Noabdy had owt to say agean
that, soa as th' public haase wor just oppened, one on 'em went in an'
browt aat a quart pitcher full an' handed it to Swallow to sup th'
furst. An' he did sup&mdash;for when he left lause ther wor nowt
left but
th' froth on his upper lip to tell at ther'd iver bin ony. "Well"
said Lijah, "aw've heeared swallows called burds of passage, but if
they'd all a passage like thee, they'd sup th' sea dry." "Tha sees,
Lijah," he said, "awm unfortunate, for aw've a thirst on me 'at aw
cannot quench, an' aw darn't sup watter for fear o' havin' th'
dropsy." All th' women agreed' at he wor reight, an' soa after another
quart amang em they went on.</p>

<p>What wi' laffin, an' talkin,' an' smookin, they gate to
Blackstone
Edge Moor, an' some of the women thowt it time for a rest, soa Swallow
stop'd all at once an' said, "Do yo all see that stooan post 'at's
standin' thear? That's the stooan at devides Yorksher an' Lankysher,
an' aw think this a 'varry fit time to say a few words woll yo ease
yor legs a bit." Soa up he climb'd onto th' pooast, an' began praichin
away, an' kept at it woll they wor all hauf pined to deeath. At last
Lijah said, "Hang it up, ha long are ta baan to talk? aw wonder thi
conscience doesn't prick thee!" "Prick me!" he said, "Aw defy owt to
prick me when awm laborin' for a gooid cause." Just then he ovver
balanced hissel an' fell slap into th' middle ov a whin bush; but he
wor up in a crack, an' one o' th' lasses said, "if his conscience
hadn't getten prick'd summat else had," an' they went forrard, but
Swallow kept his hand under his coit lap for a mile or two. They gate
to th' lake at last, an' after enjayin' what they call th' seea
breeze, they started off to see some o' th' places ov interest. One
o' th' furst they steer'd to wor th' birthplace o' Tim Bobbin. "An'
who wor Tim Bobbin?" said one o' th' lasses. This puzzled 'em, for
ther worn't one i'th' lot 'at knew; but one o' th' chaps said he
thowt, if he worn't mistakken, he war th' inventor o' th' spinnin'
mule. Th' superintendent said that wor varry likely, for he'd oft
nooatised when readin' history books, 'at chaps gate ther names throo
summat they'd done, an' soa varry likely he gate called Tim Bobbin for
that reason. After that they went back an' had a ride in a booat, an'
as nooan on em knew ha to row, th' watter were varry sooin ankle deep
inside; some on 'em began to grummel at this. "Oh, niver heed," said
Swallow, "yo'll niver catch cold wi' salt watter." It worn't long
afoor they wanted ther tea, soa they went into th' haase an' ordered a
gooid feed. Aw've heeard cunjurors say, "Quick, Jack, fly," when
they've been puttin' summat aat o'th' seet; but ther worn't time to
say that wi' them, for th' breead and butter went like leetnin'. One
plate full after another kept comin' in, till at last th' mistress
said, "Aw think yo must ha' been hungry?" "E'ea, it's change o'
climate 'at does it," they said. Soa shoo browt in a fresh lot, but
it made noa difference; away it went after tother. "Do yo' know,".
shoo says, when shoo coom in agean, "at yo've etten two pund o' breead
apiece?" "Why what's two pund when its cut thin," they said? An' at
it they went agean. When they couldn't find room for ony moor, they
paid ther shot an' started off hooam, whear they landed safely. Th'
next Sunday neet, when th' gas wor lit at schooil iverybody wor capt
to see what an' improvement th' new meter wor. Soa after passin' a
vote o' thanks to th' superintendent an' th' taichers for th' trouble
they' been put to, th' matter dropt.</p>

<h4><a name="Plagues."></a>Plagues.</h4>

<p>A lecture on this subject was delivered on Tuesday evening, to
the
members of the Ladies' Needle and Thimble Association, by the Rev.
James Sleek, curate of St. Enock's-in-the-Mist. After adverting to the
plagues of Egypt, the learned lecturer dwelt at length upon the
plagues of the present day, which he classed under the following heads:
&mdash;Servants, poor relations, borrowers, teetotallars,
tobacco-smokers,
and children in arms. To counteract these evils were such associations
as the one he had the honor to address, select tea meetings, fancy
bazaars, and perambulators. The lecture gave great satisfaction.</p>

<h4><a name="End_o_th_Year."></a>End o' th'

<p>It's a long loin 'at's niver a turn, an' th' longest loin ends
somewhear. Ther's a end to mooast things, an' this is th' end o' the
year. When a chap gets turned o' forty, years dooant seem as long as
once they did&mdash;he begins to be feeared o' time rolling
on&mdash;but it's
fooilish, for it nawther gooas faster nor slower nor iver it did. But
he's a happy chap 'at, when th' year ends, can luk back an' think ha
mich gooid he's done, for it isn't what a chap will do for th' futer,
its what he has done i'th' past 'at fowk mun judge by. Its net wise
for onybody to booast o' what they mean to do in a month's time,
becoss we cannot tell what a month's time may do for us. We can
hardly help havin' a gloomy thowt or two at this part o'th' year, but
Kursmiss comes to cheer us up a bit, an' he's nooan ov a gooid sooart
'at can't be jolly once i'th' year. As an owd friend o' mine has
cliverly said:&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Come let us choose the
better part,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And sing whilst life is

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Gives no offence to Heaven.</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">'Tis Christmas time,
then fill the horn,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Away with melancholy,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">If there's no leaves
upon the thorn,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">There is upon the holly.<br>

<br>

</span>
<p>Hi! varry true! When ther's no leaves upon th' thorn, they're
green
upon the holly. Ther's allus summat to be thankful for if we seek it
aat&mdash;ther's sure to be a bit o' sunshine
somewhere&mdash;an' its a varry
bad case if a chap can't find consolation aat o' summat.</p>

<p>Aw remember a case ov a woman deein' 'at aw knew, an' aw met
th'
husband lukkin' varry glum a bit at after. "Well Joa," aw said,
"tha's had a heavy loss, lad." "Eea, aw have," an' then after
studdyin' a bit, he said, "but aw should ha had to ha bowt a new suit
afoor long, an' aw mud as weel buy black as any other color; it wod ha
been awkerd if aw'd just getten a white hat, as aw thowt
on&mdash;but
Providence! orders all things for th' best."</p>

<p>Ther's noa daat a gooid lot on us find consolation aat o'th'
Kursmiss
jollification&mdash;its just a bit ov a sweetener afoor all th'
nooats
begin o' commin' in; aw dooant mean five paand nooats, ther's nooan
monny o' them stirrin'. It's th' coil nooats, an' gas nooats, an' tax
papers, them's th' sooart at's stirrin abaat this time. Wheniver
ther's a knock at th' door, yo may ventur to put yor hand i' yor
pocket; an' happy he must feel 'at can allus find as mich thear as'll
do. But its time enuff to think abaat that sooart o' thing when it
comes; we've plenty to do nah to think abaat plum pudding an' rooast
beef&mdash;an' aw hooap at iverybody 'at reads this may have enuff
an' to

wod, but as that's aat o' mi paar, just afoor aw leave for another
twelve months aw'll gie yo a tooast, an' aw hooap yo'll all drink a

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
